# HwGame1_Mifan Devlog

Initially, I had a different idea for this assignment. Right now, I technically have a walking simulator inside a small house, but my first idea was going to be a comic book. The player playing as my cat, Mifan, will be reading through the heroic tales of Mifan vs. cockroaches. However, I decided to change that idea so that the players can walk around and figure out the world on their own. If I was a master game developer, there would've been a lot more features in this walking simulator. For example, since I basically had 2 sections (human's house and cockroach territory), I thought about dimming one section if the player is roaming the other section. So, I guess I didn't achieve my own hopes in the game because I just didn't know how to do a lot of things in Unity yet. However, I did learn part of the very basics of Unity, like writing code, importing sprites/audio, working with animation, etc. On the other hand, I think there are definetly more efficient ways to do things, like I'm sure there's a better way to create multiple cockroaches than just copy and pasting each sprite and adjsuting the size (?).
